# SITL

I removed the navigation and related metadata, but the snippet you provided only contained navigation links and a "last updated" note — there’s no main page content to convert into GitBook-optimized markdown.

Please paste the page's main content (the article/body) you want converted, and I will:

* Convert package-manager install blocks into tabs (npm/yarn/pnpm).
* Turn multi-step numbered lists into a stepper.
* Convert FAQs into expandable blocks.
* Use GitBook advanced blocks where appropriate while preserving all links and original meaning.

If you want, I can also show an example of how a converted page would look given a short sample. Which would you prefer?
