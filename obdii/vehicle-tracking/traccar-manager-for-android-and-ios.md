Traccar Manager is a mobile application to manage GPS tracking devices. It requires a Traccar server instance to work.

By default application is configured to use a [demo server](broken-reference). Traccar Manager shows server selection screen only on the first start. You should use the same URL you use to connect to the web app. To change the server address later you have to re-install the app (iOS) or clear app settings from application manager (Android).
