# Demo Servers

Demo servers are fully-featured instances of Traccar that you can use to track your GPS devices or phones. There are no limits on available features or number of devices. Demo servers don't have reverse geocoding or email service pre-configured. If you are interested in those services, please check one of our [paid options](broken-reference).

There is no pre-defined demo user or sample data. You have to register your own account by clicking on "Register" button on the login screen. To get sample data you can use [Traccar Client app](broken-reference) on your smartphone.

There are several servers available. Feel free to choose any of them, but the first server is usually overloaded as Traccar Client is configured to use it by default. Quality of service is not guaranteed. If you need guaranteed uptime and full history for your servers, please check one of the [subscriptions](broken-reference).
