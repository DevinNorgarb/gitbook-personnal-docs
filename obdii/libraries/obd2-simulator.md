# OBD2 Simulator

### Story

It was troublesome to have to prepare a vehicle when making OBD2 device and related services. With this OBD2 simulator, you can develop OBD2 equipment on the desk without going to the garage.

12V DC power required. When BLE is connected to the mobile device, various parameters, engine speed, car speed, coolant temperature, etc. can be set with the slider bar.

You can modify the software by Arduino IDE by connecting the PC through the micro USB connection.

The idea of the design is based on [OBD2 Robot Controller "CAR MATE](https://www.hackster.io/ebaera/obd2-robot-controller-car-mate)." Protocol IC is MCP2515 and I used the Arduino-compatible library: [https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP\_CAN\_lib](https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP\_CAN\_lib). I found [OBD2 Connector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0141UPYDC/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o02\_s00?ie=UTF8\&psc=1) in amazon.com.
