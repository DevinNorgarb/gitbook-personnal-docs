# AIS RESEARCH USING A RASPBERRY PI (2022 Update)

### AIS RESEARCH USING A RASPBERRY PI (2022 Update)

**Gary C. Kessler**\
**11 September 2023**

> The Raspberry Pi is a family of low-cost, single-board computers developed by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) in the U.K. Since its introduction in 2012, it has emerged as a widely-used platform for embedded system research and project hobbyists. Most users use some form of the Linux operating system on the Raspberry Pi; equipped with several USB ports, quad-core processor, an IEEE 802.3/Ethernet port, IEEE 802.11 WiFi and Bluetooth capability, HDMI connector, audio output, and a general-purpose input/output (GPIO) bus, it is a very powerful tool for research, exploration, teaching, and learning.
>
> There are many documents on the Internet that describe various aspects of using a Raspberry Pi to create a marine Automatic Identification System (AIS) display. While I don't want to repeat all of those sites — and, hopefully, I won't — I wanted to put everything into one place, particularly for other AIS researchers who are looking for a push up the learning curve. I hope that this page accomplishes that goal.
>
> > For purposes of this paper, I am assuming that readers understand the fundamentals of AIS. To get a lot more information, check out the USCG Navigation Center's [Automatic Identification System Overview](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=AISmain), IALA's [_An Overview of AIS_ (Edition 2)](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/IALA\_Guideline\_1082\_An\_Overview\_of\_AIS.pdf), or the [automatic identification system (AIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic\_identification\_system) article at Wikipedia.

> Hardware
>
> * _Raspberry Pi:_ Essential hardware, obviously, since this is the title of the paper! There are many sources and I leave that to the reader. Be sure to get the latest version of the hardware. _(The information on this page has been tested, and is running, on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. Everything should still work on the current version of the hardware, the Raspberry Pi 4.)_![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_rasberrypi.jpg)
> * _dAISy Hat AIS Receiver:_ If you are doing AIS projects, you will need some type of AIS receiver. There are a number of options; one way is to get an external receiver and connect it to the Raspberry Pi's USB port. My suggestion is the dAISy Hat 2-channel AIS receiver, a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi. Designed by Wegmatt, the primary source is [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/astuder/daisy-hat-ais-receiver-for-raspberry-pi/).
> *
>   * ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_daisyhat1.jpg)     ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_daisyhat2.png)
>   * NOTE: If you use an antenna for your dAISy Hat, note the terminating connector. If it comes with a male BNC plug, it should attach directly to the dAISy Hat's female BNC jack. If it comes with a coaxial cable, it most likely terminates with a male PL-259/SO-239 plug, thus, you will need an adapter. I would recommend getting the SO-239 pigtail or BNC-to-SO-239 adapter when you buy the dAISy Hat.
>   * _A note on antenna connector nomenclature:_ According to most sources that I can find, references to SO-239 and PL-259 are mated connector pairs for coaxial cable terminations. In general, the SO-239 (aka UHF Female or UHF Jack) is the connector on a radio or chassis and the PL-259 (aka UHF Male or UHF Plug) is the connector on a cable. You may also find a "male SO-239" or a "female PL-259" product listings. Be sure to look at the pictures!
> * ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_uhf.gif)
> * _µSD card:_ The operating system, all files, and on-board storage for the Raspberry Pi reside on a single microSD card. Ideally, get a card with a capacity of 32 GB or 64 GB. Most microSD cards come with an adapter so that they can fit into a computer's SD card slot. If you don't have such a card slot, you might also need to obtain a µSD/SD-to-USB reader.
> * _Case (optional):_ Although it is not absolutely necessary to have a case, I would recommend getting the case that comes with the dAISy Hat in order to protect all of the components when everything is in use.
> * _Other hardware (optional):_ In order to initially configure the Raspberry Pi, you might also want to have on hand an HDMI-capable monitor, an HDMI cable, and a wireless/USB keyboard and mouse. You should also have an Ethernet cable and router for a network connection _or_ an open WiFi network.
> * _Antenna (optional):_ You will need an antenna if you wish to pick up AIS signals from the outside. AIS uses two VHF maritime frequencies, 161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz. Any antenna that can work in these frequencies — or is labelled "VHF marine antenna" — ought to work fine for AIS projects. As noted above, be sure to check out the antenna cable connector.

> Installing Raspberry Pi OS
>
> > _Before going any further, I would like you to be aware of an entirely different direction you can take. AISHub offers_ [_rPiAIS_](https://www.aishub.net/rpiais)_, an implementation of_ AIS Dispatcher _for the Raspberry Pi. Depending upon what you're trying to do, rPiAIS might be worth looking into._
>
> There are several lightweight Linux (and other) operating systems that can run on the Raspberry Pi. The native OS is Raspberry Pi OS (nee Raspian), a variant of Debian. The best source for all of these is the Raspberry Pi Foundation's [_Software_](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) page, and follow the instructions.
>
> 1. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager.
> 2. (Optional) Watch the [45-second installation video](https://youtu.be/ntaXWS8Lk34).
> 3. Attach a microSD card to your computer.
> 4. \
>    ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_imager.png)\
>
> 5. Execute the Raspberry Pi Imager application:
> 6.
>    1. Click the _CHOOSE OS_ button to select the OS to install. You probably want _Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)_.
>    2. (Optional but highly recommended) Press CTRL+SHIFT+X to preconfigure the OS. At this point, set the hostname, enable SSH (not required, but recommended), set the username and password, enable WiFi (be sure to properly set the country), and set locale information.
>    3. Click the _CHOOSE STORAGE_ button to select the SD card on which to install the OS. You probably want _Generic MassStorageClass Media_.
>    4. Click the _WRITE_ button to write and verify the image on the microSD card.
>    5. \
>       ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_imager\_success.png)\
>
>    6. The OS is installed when you see the message above. Click _CONTINUE_.
> 7. Exit the Raspberry Pi Imager application.
>

> Configuring the Raspberry Pi
>
> You're now ready to get the Raspberry Pi running! For additional information on this phase, see the [_Getting started with Raspberry Pi_](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi) page.
>
> 1. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi's SD card slot, attach your I/O devices (i.e., keyboard/mouse/monitor), and power it up.
> 2. You should see a red LED light up on the Raspberry Pi; this indicates that it is booting. It might take a few minutes, but you will soon see what appears to be a Linux-like desktop!
> 3. Enter the configuration menu by clicking on the Raspberry icon ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_raspberry\_icon.png) in the upper left of the screen, and then select _Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration_:![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_raspi\_config.png)\
>
> 4. If you entered configuration information above during the microSD card imaging process, your Raspberry Pi is already mostly configured (except missing a couple of essential elements, discussed below). You should step through the configuration tabs to ensure that what you want is there. This is also the place to enter any missing information or change information later.
> 5. \
>
> 6.
>    * The _System_ tab shows the system's _Hostname_. This is also where you can _Change Password_, direct the boot process to the desktop or command line interface (CLI), set the automatic login option, and more.
> 7. \
>    ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_raspi\_config\_system.png)\
>
> 8. You will need to make some changes on the _Interfaces_ tab:
> 9.
>    * Be sure that the _Serial Port_ slider is set
>    * If you enabled SSH in the imaging process, confirm that the _SSH_ slider is set. You should probably also enable VNC to allow remote login to the desktop. \[NOTE: You might need to engage port forwarding and/or make other changes to your firewall to allow SSH/VNC traffic into your network. SSH uses TCP port 22 and VNC uses TCP port 5900.]
>    * If SSH is enabled, you can also easily get FTP access to the device using any FTP client that supports SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). \[Do not confuse SFTP with FTPS; the latter is FTP over SSL/TLS.]
> 10. \
>     ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_raspi\_config\_if.png)\
>
> 11. Information on the _Localisation_ tab should be mostly set if you entered information during the imaging process:
> 12.
>     * Set your language and country by clicking the _Set Locale..._ button. This information was not provided during the imaging process so enter it here.
>     * Set your time zone area and location by clicking the _Set Timezone..._ button.
>     * Set the keyboard model and layout by clicking the _Set Keyboard..._ button.
>     * If you intend to use WiFi, click the _Set WiFi Country..._ button to select a country.
> 13. \
>     ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_raspi\_config\_local.png)\
>
> 14. When the configuration looks ok, click _OK_. You'll be asked if you want to reboot; click the "Yes" button.
>
> You can perform the same functions from the command line by opening a terminal window and entering:
>
> ```
>      sudo raspi-config
> ```
>
> Additional information on using the command line configuration utility can be found at the Raspberry Pi Foundation's [_raspi-config_](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md) page.
>
> Once you've set a WiFi country, the Raspberry Pi should automatically find any available WiFi network that is broadcasting its SSID _if_ a network cable is not physically attached. If you want to connect to any WiFi network that doesn't broadcast an SSID, you will need to edit the _/etc/wpa\_supplicant/wpa\_supplicant.conf_ file in order to add the hidden network information. Note that WiFi information is already configured if you entered a network name during the microSD card imaging process, above. The paragraphs below provide information that you might need in order to change WiFi network settings or better understand the contents of the _wpa\_supplicant.conf_ file.
>
> What follows is an example of how you might configure the _wpa\_supplicant.conf_ file if you have two WiFi networks, namely, a non-broadcast SSID "Guest" network that requires no password and a non-broadcast SSID "Owner" network with the password "Secret" (using WPA). Open the file by entering the following on the command line (you need to use _sudo_ here because this is a system file):
>
> ```
>      sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
> ```
>
> Now, add the following lines to the config file:
>
> ```
>    network={
>            scan_ssid=1
>            ssid="Guest"
>            key_mgmt=NONE}
>    network={
>            scan_ssid=1
>            ssid="Owner"
>            psk="Secret"
>            key_mgmt=WPA-PSK}
> ```
>
> After adding the lines, press control-O (^O) to write the file and ^X to exit. The Raspi will now see the hidden networks as well as any openly advertised networks.
>
> > NOTE: Raspberry Pi OS comes with several easy-to-use text editors. _nano_, referenced above, is a nice command line editor. A GUI text editor can be found by clicking the Raspberry icon, Accessories, and Text Editor.
>
> Finally, a note about screen resolution. If you access the Raspberry Pi strictly via SSH or VNC, it is referred to as a _headless_ connection. Regardless of whether you access remotely or output to an HDMI monitor, if you don't like the screen resolution, you can always change it via the _Display_ tab in the _Raspberry Pi Configuration_ menu. Alternatively, open the _/boot/config.txt_ file with your favorite text editor (be sure to use _sudo_). Scroll down to find these lines:
>
> ```
> # uncomment to force a console size. By default it will be display's size minus
> # overscan.
> #framebuffer_width=1280
> #framebuffer_height=720
> ```
>
> Uncomment the two _framebuffer_ commands by removing the leading hash (#). Save the file, reboot, and your screen resolution will be different! You might need to experiment around a bit to find the right size for your monitor.
>
> > FINAL NOTE: If you enter configuration information during the microSD card imaging phase, the Raspberry Pi will startup in headless mode. In that case, you might not need an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to get started. Boot the Raspberry Pi, connect via SSH, run _raspi-config_ from the command line, enable VNC, and reboot. After that, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi's desktop with VNC.

> Installing dAISy Hat
>
> Installing the dAISy Hat hardware is very straight-forward. You'll probably want to download the [_dAISy HAT AIS Receiver Manual_](http://www.wegmatt.com/files/dAISy%20HAT%20AIS%20Receiver%20Manual.pdf) for additional reference.
>
> If you have played with computer hardware before, then installing the dAISy Hat daughterboard to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins won't be a problem. If you haven't done this before, all I can say is to work slowly, align the socket on the board onto the Raspberry Pi's pins carefully, and press the cards together slowly and evenly.
>
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_daisyhat\_installed.jpg)
>
> ***
>
> The remainder of this section describes some command-line tools that allow you to determine the status of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. This step is optional; it provides useful information if you would like to know more about the hardware, but is not essential to the operation of the dAISy Hat, the Raspberry Pi, or _OpenCPN_.
>
> Raspberry Pi OS comes with the _raspi-gpio_ command, which lists the state of the GPIO pins, one pin per line:
>
> ```
>      raspi-gpio get
> ```
>
> To learn more, use the _help_ argument to see all of the options.
>
> If you want a somewhat easier-to-read representation of the GPIO status, download _gpioread_ from Ian Binnie's (Milliways2) GitHub page. (_gpioread_ replaces the deprecated _gpio readall_ utility that came with Raspian.) Start by opening up a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi and then execute the following commands:
>
> ```
>      cd ~
>      wget https://github.com/Milliways2/gpioread/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
>      unzip master.zip
>      cd gpioread-master
>      sudo pigpiod
>      ./gpioread.py
> ```
>
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_gpio.png)

> Installing _screenscreen_ is a terminal emulator with which you can communicate directly with the serial port, providing a mechanism with which to control and manage the dAISy Hat hardware. This step is optional; _screen_ provides useful information but is not essential to the operation of the dAISy Hat or _OpenCPN_.Install _screen_ by issuing the following command from a terminal window:     sudo apt-get install screenThe dAISy Hat should be attached to Serial 0 port; under Raspberry Pi OS, note that _/dev/serial0_ is an alias for _/dev/ttyS0_. To connect to the hardware, type:     screen /dev/serial0 38400Press \<ESC> and you should see a display such as the following:![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_screen.png)
>
> Note that if you press _T_, you will enter a mode where you can send AIS test messages (as [National Marine Electronics Association \[NMEA\] 0183](https://www.nmea.org/content/STANDARDS/NMEA\_0183\_Standard) / [International Telecommunication Union \[ITU\] Recommendation M.1371-5](https://www.itu.int/dms\_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1371-5-201402-I!!PDF-E.pdf) sentences):
>
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_screen\_T.png)
>
> If you press \<ENTER>, the software will transmit the AIS Type 4 message (Base Station Report) shown here every five seconds. Pressing \<ESC> stops the transmission of test messages; pressing \<ESC> again returns the device to receive mode. (If you are curious what the message says, use one of the AIS parsing Web sites or my AIS parser software described in the [_Interpreting the Data_](https://www.garykessler.net/library/ais\_pi.html#data) section below.)
>
> You can exit _screen_ by entering command mode (^A), then pressing _K_ (kill process), followed by _Y_ (yes). To obtain a complete list of _screen_ commands and options, type:
>
> ```
>      man screen

> OpenCPN_OpenCPN_ is free, open source chartplotter and maritime GPS navigation software that can run on Android, Debian, Fedora, Flatpak, Linux, MacOS, Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu, and Windows systems — it seems about every platform except iPadOS and iOS. While designed to be used while underway or for planning purposes, it also provides a useful tool for AIS projects.![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn.png)
>
> > For my research purposes, I use OpenCPN to track both live and spoofed traffic. I do not actually transmit AIS messages over the air, but examine the effects using OpenCPN on the same system that generates the bogus AIS traffic and is receiving real AIS traffic. There is a very cool GitHub site that describes [MAIANA™: The Open Source AIS Transponder](https://github.com/peterantypas/maiana) if you are looking for an alternative to using a software-defined radio (SDR) approach.
>
> To learn more about OpenCPN, visit [OpenCPN.org](https://opencpn.org/), the source of all things OpenCPN! In particular, there are a wide variety of manuals to be found at that site, including:
>
> * [OpenCPN Manuals](https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn)
> * [OpenCPN User Manual](https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn\_user\_manual)

>
> The steps outlined below should work on Raspberry Pi OS version 11 (aka _bullseye_). If you are not sure what version of Raspian or other Linux distro you are using, use the following command:
>
> ```
>      cat /etc/os-release
> ```
>
> Prepare for the OpenCPN installation by creating an _opencpn_ directory under your home directory:
>
> ```
>      mkdir ~/opencpn
>      cd ~/opencpn
> ```
>
> **PGP Key Management**The first step in order to download and install OpenCPN is to manually create a Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) keyfile. This process will ensure that you have the latest, most current key.
>
> 1. Point your browser to the [OpenPGP Public Key Server](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/).
> 2.
>    * In the Search String field, enter the key _0xC865EB40_.
>    * All options should be OFF except "Get verbose index of matching keys."
>    * Click the _Search Key_ button.
> 3. ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_openpgp\_keyserver.png)
> 4. A new Web page, similar to the one below, will open. Click on the _rsa1024/_ link provided in the _pub_ section.
> 5. ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_openpgp\_results.png)
> 6. This should take you to page similar to the one below that contains the key.
> 7. ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_openpgp\_key.png)
> 8. Use nano or another text editor to open/create a text file called _opencpn\_key.txt_ (or, use another name if you want) in the _opencpn_ directory. Copy the Web page text starting from "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" to the end of the page, and paste it into the _opencpn\_key.txt_ file. Use ^O to write the file and ^X to exit the editor. Use the _cat opencpn\_key.txt_ command to verify the file.
>
> **Download and Install OpenCPN**Start the OpenCPN installation by typing:     sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.listThe nano text editor will open. Move the cursor to the end of the file and add this line (assuming that you are using Raspberry Pi OS "bullseye"):     deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/opencpn/opencpn/ubuntu/ bullseye mainIn the command above, you are obtaining an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive (PPA) that is compatible with your version of Raspberry Pi OS. The keyword _bullseye_ refers to the version of Ubuntu compatible with Raspberry Pi OS version 11. If using Raspian Stretch, the compatible Ubuntu release is _xenial_; for Raspian Buster, it is _bionic_.Save the updates and close the file.Now, install the PGP key, get updated software sources, and install OpenCPN:     sudo apt-key add opencpn\_key.txt     sudo apt-get update     sudo apt-get install opencpnThere may be some error messages; read them and document any additional commands that you need to execute.**Run and Configure OpenCPN**Run OpenCPN by typing opencpn from the command line _or_ by clicking the Application (Raspberry) icon, _Education, OpenCPN_ from the GUI.The first thing to do, in almost all cases, will be to load some charts; this is possibly the most painful part of OpenCPN:Click on Options (the crescent wrench or gear icon)![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_options1.png) ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_options2.png)Click on Charts![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_charts.png)Here is where things can get a bit complicated. The easiest way to download charts is to select the _Chart Downloader_ tab.\
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_options\_charts.png)\
> Click the _Add Catalog_ button to see the Chart Catalog. From here, you can scroll down to see a variety of chart catalogs. In this case, I select the "USA - NOAA & Inland charts" catalog of Electronic Navigation Charts (ENC). \[\[ Where possible, use ENC charts... ]]\
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_chart\_catalog.png)\
> The ENC NOAA charts can be viewed by state, USCG District, and other options. In this case, I select "by States" and scroll down to select "Florida" by clicking _OK_.\

> Download the desired catalogs into the directory by clicking the _OK_ button.Select a catalog by clicking on it. Next, click on the _Download Charts..._ tab. You should see a list of chart names. Scroll through the box to select the charts that you want. In order to make this selection, you need to know the name of the chart(s) you want; knowing the chart number is useful, but only as a way to learn the name because the catalog in OpenCPN only lists names. Click the "Download selected charts" button to download the charts to your system. When that is complete, click _OK_.\

> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_debugWindow\_network.png)Note that when using OpenCPN with a network data source, the raw data feed can be captured directly using the _netcat_ (nc) or _telnet_ command, in the form:     nc SOURCE\_IP\_ADDRESS PORT     telnet SOURCE\_IP\_ADDRESS PORT\
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_nc.png)\
> OpenCPN can also be used as a data server and create a data stream from its input. This is particularly useful if you are reading from a serial interface; OpenCPN can read from serial0, for example, and produce a TCP data stream. Setting this up is very straight-forward:Add a new connection, as above.Click the _Network_ radio buttonSelect the TCP protocolUse the IP address 0.0.0.0 since you are using yourself as the sourceEnter the port number you'd like to use (it is best to use a value in the range 1024-65535)Uncheck the _Receive input on this Port_ boxCheck the _Output on this port_ boxClick _OK_\
> ![](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_opencpn\_output\_connection.png)At this point, you have two open connections, and OpenCPN is accepting input from whatever source you had been using and sending output on your desired TCP port.\

> Finally... one of the problems that is immediately apparent from the raw output stream is that AIS lacks timestamp information. While OpenCPN displays a timestamp in the Debug Window, that is not part of the AIS message and, therefore, not a part of the raw data stream that can be captured. To remedy this, I wrote a small Perl program called _timestamp\_data_ that can connect to a TCP or UDP socket on a local or remote host, and read a data stream for a specified amount of time. Output is directed to a file complete with a human-readable and Unix epoch-formatted timestamp of when the data was received; fields in the file are delimited with a "pipe" (|) character. Users can, optionally, also see the data in real-time. The program can be found on my [software page](https://www.garykessler.net/software/index.html#timestamp).

> > SIDENOTE: Sending data to OpenCPNIf you have a file filled with AIS messages, it is also possible to send that data to OpenCPN for display. First, you need to set up OpenCPN to _listen_ on a TCP port rather than send. Just create a new OpenCPN connection on the port of your choice to address 0.0.0.0, as shown above, but check the box to "Receive input on this port."There are a variety of methods with which to send the data to OpenCPN at this point. You could just transmit the entire file via _netcat_:     cat FILENAME | nc localhost PORTUsing the method above will work but all it does is dump the entire AIS message stream to OpenCPN at one time so you just see the last sentence transmitted by each vessel. If you want to slow things down a little, add a delay between the display of each line in the data file using some shell scripting:     cat FILENAME | { while read line; do sleep 2; echo "$line" | nc localhost PORT ; done; }     cat FILENAME | { while read line; do sleep 1; echo "$line" > /dev/tcp/localhost/PORT ; done; }

> > Again, the method above works but it puts in a fixed delay. If you used a tool that attaches a timestamp to your data or you otherwise have a data file with a timestamp on each message (e.g., you got the data using the _timestamp\_data_ tool above), you can replay the data in OpenCPN in relative real-time using another one of my tools, [_play\_ais_](https://www.garykessler.net/software/index.html#play). This program only needs a character-delimited file where each record has a timestamp (in seconds) and valid AIS sentence; a short video about using this approach can be found [on my Web page](https://www.garykessler.net/library/images/ais\_replay.mp4) (NOTE: The program was called _replay_ at the time that I made the video).

The program, which replaces the Chrome-only plug-in, runs on Linux, MacOS, Raspberry Pi OS (armv7l), and Windows.

> Interpreting the Data
>
> There are a variety of sources that will help you interpret the raw NMEA/ITU sentences that are transmitted over the air. The "AIVDM" sentences that AIS devices typically see are the NMEA 0183 AIS incoming transmissions (as opposed to AIVDO outgoing transmissions). Possibly the best online, open-source reference as to the details of the NMEA/ITU sentence content is Eric Raymond's [AIVDM/AIVDO protocol decoding](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html) page.
>
> There are also a number of AIS parsers online, where you can submit an NMEA sentence for interpretation, as shown below (from the Maritec Solutions online parser):
