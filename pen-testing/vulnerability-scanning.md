In the past blog posts we've been writing about [OSINT Tools](https://securitytrails.com/blog/osint-tools), and also about [how to prevent DNS attacks](https://securitytrails.com/blog/8-tips-to-prevent-dns-attacks) when you are running your own DNS servers, and today we are focusing on Wordpress Security.

When we talk about security, we talk about services, and a lot of those are public websites.

According to the latest W3Techs [report as of July 2018](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all), Wordpress is used by 31% of the existing websites. That's a lot.

Latest [Sucuri hacked websites report](https://sucuri.net/reports/2017-hacked-website-report) for the past 2017 also revealed WordPress infections rose from 74% in 2016 Q3 to 83% in 2017 — that's not good at all. It is without any doubt one of the most attacked CMS platforms.

Wordpress is easy to use, has a fast learning curve, and can be installed by almost anybody without any programming or technical skills. But, it can become your worst nightmare if you don't know how to keep it secure.

So, how can you test whether your Wordpress installation is secure? Keep reading.

### [¶](https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-5-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners#content-most-popular-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners)Most popular Wordpress Vulnerability Scanners

Website owners often tend to install Wordpress, choose a theme, configure the needed plugins, but completely forget about hardening Wordpress, which include keeping your WP core, themes, and plugins updated, among other things.

Is your Wordpress installation really secure against external attacks? How can you find vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your current Wordpress site?

Let's answer these questions by exploring the finest Wordpress vulnerability scanners in order to find and fix any security flaws in your WordPress website today.

#### [¶](https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-5-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners#content-1-wpscan)**1. WPScan**

[WPScan](https://wpscan.org/) is one of the best vulnerability scanners for Wordpress and works like a charm from the terminal, where you can run remote vulnerability tests against your WP installations.

Using WPScan allows you to analyze the security of your current WordPress website to:

* Detect known vulnerabilities in the WP core, as well as themes and plugins
* Detect if any registered user is using weak passwords
* Check overall WP security configuration
* Run brute force penetration testings
* Wordpress Version enumeration (from generator meta tag)
* Full server headers scanning
* Miscellaneous WordPress checks, such as directory used, theme names, custom dirs, etc.

This WP security tool works by using the [wpvulndb.com](https://wpvulndb.com/) database to keep the vulnerability database up to date. It also has a very extended [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/wpscanteam/wpscan/frames) for developers to improve the security scanning against Wordpress installations.

[**¶**](https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-5-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners#content-installing-wpscan)**Installing WPScan**

Note: WPScan comes pre-installed on the most popular penetration and security-based Linux distributions like Kali Linux, BackBox Linux, Pentoo, and BlackArch.

Let's solve the required dependencies first for the most popular Linux distributions.

Ubuntu requirements:

```sql
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev ruby-dev build-essential libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Debian requirements:

```nginx
sudo apt-get install gcc git ruby ruby-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev make zlib1g-dev
```

Fedora requirements:

```sql
sudo dnf install gcc ruby-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel libcurl-devel patch rpm-build
```

Let's clone the WPScan GitHub repo, and then install the app in our test box, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan.git
cd wpscan
sudo gem install bundler && bundle install --without test
```

Let's see if it was installed ok. Run this command and it should display the WPScan banner and version:

```markdown
ruby wpscan.rb --version

[research@securitytrails wpscan]# ruby wpscan.rb --version
_______________________________________________________________
        __          _______   _____

          \ \/  \/ / |  ___/ \___ \ / __|/ _` | '_ \
           \  /\  /  | |     ____) | (__| (_| | | | |
            \/  \/   |_|    |_____/ \___|\__,_|_| |_|

_______________________________________________________________

Current version: 2.9.5-dev
[research@securitytrails wpscan]#
```

If you see that, then it was installed OK. Now let's see the most popular arguments you can use:

```sql
--update                            Update the database to the latest version.
--url       | -u        The WordPress URL/domain to scan.
--force     | -f                    Forces WPScan to not check if the remote site is running WordPress.
```

For the full list of arguments, try:

```bash
ruby wpscan.rb --help
```

[**¶**](https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-5-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners#content-running-our-first-wpscan-against-wordpress)**Running our first WPScan against Wordpress**

Now that you have WPScan installed and working, let's begin with the fun stuff.

First things first, let's update the WPScan vulnerability database:

```nginx
ruby wpscan.rb --update
```

Now, launch your first scan:

```nginx
ruby wpscan.rb --url yourwordpress.com
```

Replace "yourwordpress.com" with the URL of your website.

You should get something like this:

```sql

```

As you see, the scan was able to detect WP usernames, plugin versions, theme name & version, as well as WP core version, and detect if you are running the latest version or not.

Other popular command line arguments you can use are brute force testings using word lists, as you see below:

Brute force on enumerated users using 25 threads - Replace "mylist.lst" with your own word list.

```nginx
ruby wpscan.rb --url www.example.com --wordlist mylist.lst --threads 25
```

Same example, but only against the "admin" username:

```nginx
ruby wpscan.rb --url www.example.com --wordlist mylist.lst --username admin
```

The number of tests you can run with WPScan is really huge, explore the rest reading the online documentation from the [README file](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) on Github, or run the --help option.
