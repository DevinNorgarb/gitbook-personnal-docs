# vscan

**Vscan** is a free and open-source tool available on GitHub. Vscan has based nmap scanning techniques, the easiest and useful tool for reconnaissance. Vscan interface is very similar to Metasploit 1 and Metasploit 2. Vscan has its own modules that add additional value to the standard scanner which is nmap. Vscan has **NSE** **scripts** that give additional features to nmap to detect and find vulnerabilities and further which can be used to perform exploitation.  Nse scripts have many modules such as network discovery and backdoor detection. This tool provides a command-line interface that you can run on Kali Linux. This tool can be used to get information about our target(domain) which can be a website or an IP address. The interactive console provides a number of helpful features, such as command completion and contextual help. Vscan is a web reconnaissance tool written in **bash** script. It has so many modules such as database interaction, built-in convenience functions, NSE scripts interactive help, and command completion. Vscan provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted and you can gather all information about the domain or ip address with ports.

### **Features of NSE scripts**

* It can be used with nmap for network discoveries on ports.
* It can give more sophisticated versions in-network detection.
* It can be used to detect vulnerability detection.
* It can be used for backdoor detection on host/victim IP addresses.
* It can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the network.

### **Installation of Vscan**
