Please note that this configuration will significantly increase the heat generated by your Raspberry Pi 4. It's crucial to have adequate cooling, such as a heatsink or fan, to prevent the CPU from overheating. Additionally, overclocking can cause stability issues, so proceed with caution and monitor your system for any signs of instability.
