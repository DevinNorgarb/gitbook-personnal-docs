### Supported Websites

**Note**

After v1.0.4 release, Monkey-DL now uses a custom HLSDownloader to download from streams, which is over 10x faster than downloading from FFMPEG. FFMPEG is now optional to be installed in system. FFMPEG will only be used if there is any error occured. So for now, it is safe FFMPEG to be installed as well. FFMPEG dependency will be removed completely soon in a later release

### Download Anime Downloader \[Windows]

> Note : Currently only windows executable is provided (Linux, Mac users go to Build from source)

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Oshan96/Anime-Downloader/releases) from here and extract the zip file

### Downloading Your Favourite Anime

First of all for websites which require capatcha token, Anime Downloader uses [2captcha](https://www.2captcha.com) to bypass google recaptcha, so you need to purchase one (Check whether your anime website needs captcha token)

Open settings.json and set [2captcha](https://2captcha.com/) API key in "api\_key"

```json
"api_key":"insert_2captcha_api_key"
```

_Don't have 2captcha API key? Don't worry! You can still use this to download anime. Check the "FAQ" section on how to download if you don't have a 2captcha API key_

**In order to download from some websites (like animeultima.to) Anime Downloader requires you to have** [**FFMPEG**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) **to be downloaded (Check whether your anime website needs FFMPEG)**

* You can download FFMPEG from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* And then add the ffmpeg executable to system path Or, in your linux environment,

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Download failed and weird error came? Don't worry, it's because these websites are protected by various security measures. Simply, just visit the website manually, and restart the anime downloader!**

**Still not able to download? Go ahead and post your issue** [**here**](https://github.com/Oshan96/Anime-Downloader/issues)**. And I will look into the error and give necessary fixes!**

### Running the application

Navigate to the extracted folder and open a cmd or powershell window from that folder and execute "monkey-dl.exe" from command line.

### How to download using GUI version (v0.1.1-alpha upwards)

It is same as the CLI version, but provided a graphical user interface to collect necessary parameters.

Note : After v1.0.4 and anove, Anime Downloader was named as "Monkey-DL" and the executable is called "monkey-dl.exe"

* v1.0.4 and above: Execute the "monkey-dl.exe" to start.
* v1.0.3 and lower: Execute the "anime-dl.exe" to start.

If you're running from source files, execute the "anime-dl.py" script

```bash
python3 ./anime-dl.py
```

And the GUI will appear as following :

**Note : If you don't have a 2captcha API key, you need to provide "Recaptcha Token" in the given text field for websites require captcha token (check FAQ section)**

### How to download using anime-dl (CLI)?

First of all, you need to be familiar with the commands you can use with the Anime Downloader.

```

#### Q - I don't have a 2captcha API key, is there any workaround for that?

Answer : Yes ofcourse! If you don't have a 2captcha API key to bypass captcha, you can still download your favourite anime! _But how?_ Follow these steps and you will be up and running in no time!

Let's try it!

> Note : There was a bug in v0.0.2-alpha release regarding this solution, so please download v0.0.3-alpha

> Assumptions : let's assume you want to download bleach episodes as in the previous question

Steps :

1. Open a private window in the browser (ex: Google chrome)
2. Go to the 9anime url (Bleach page) (https://9anime.to/watch/bleach.6j9/lz7wvq)
3. Now the recaptcha will appear
4. Right click and open inspection mode (ctrl+shift+i for google chrome)
5. Solve the recaptcha appeared on page (DO NOT SUBMIT!)
6. Find the captcha answer from the webpage using inspector

Answer is the "value" of the "input" element with the id "recaptcha-token" (Find for element using this id using ctrl+f to find) Copy the "value" of the input tag

So the value/recpacha answer is :

_"03AERD8Xode9TV-gFkG-7CNkllpKoiXfDKVEZ0Lu9NjGpxVv89bjwNHkS5bcfXHqKXx746tsNW\_IUMhSVV7Aym-lcvdn6jd5Ggy1a28AQ\_BI1K380joLpYReKB0EOjJjO2oVEUpOgtPu0fgfjxABKpI9EjrDZ0T7iSsKDPfhnXebQcZxIbAwelADkZ8m4qYojn3J\_-kQyreIRCEztWyTTpm\_SoNt6lIpFxG-egDFqVF6Sg7ICPp0QQrPa5UC-6pecgs\_3xspg7PN48VOXGfHH4PCARIaGVL-J5CYNsesqUuZ4t\_4kni9euduhtB3KCrV1\_IYOhymepwczWIKKPGmze2DKVddoDBABlS8NZaxHRFAzNjjJHOhlRyblBMlmerK\_Mu5N25bZeY5ZZ"_

Now we have what we need!

All you have to do is, add -c or --code command to the previous example's code like below

```bash
./anime-dl.py -u https://9anime.to/watch/bleach.6j9/lz7wvq -s 100 -e 130 -n https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach -d "D:\Anime\Bleach" -t 4 -f False -c 03AERD8Xode9TV-gFkG-7CNkllpKoiXfDKVEZ0Lu9NjGpxVv89bjwNHkS5bcfXHqKXx746tsNW_IUMhSVV7Aym-lcvdn6jd5Ggy1a28AQ_BI1K380joLpYReKB0EOjJjO2oVEUpOgtPu0fgfjxABKpI9EjrDZ0T7iSsKDPfhnXebQcZxIbAwelADkZ8m4qYojn3J_-kQyreIRCEztWyTTpm_SoNt6lIpFxG-egDFqVF6Sg7ICPp0QQrPa5UC-6pecgs_3xspg7PN48VOXGfHH4PCARIaGVL-J5CYNsesqUuZ4t_4kni9euduhtB3KCrV1_IYOhymepwczWIKKPGmze2DKVddoDBABlS8NZaxHRFAzNjjJHOhlRyblBMlmerK_Mu5N25bZeY5ZZ
```

#### Recaptcha does not appear even in private browsing. What can I do?

Answer :

> Assumptions : let's assume you want to download bleach episodes as in the previous question

This can be solved in 2 steps.

1. Run the anime-dl commands without -c/--code command (like you have a 2captcha key) This will probably give error, but that's what we need.
2. Now try loading the recaptcha page in private browsing. It will appear!

#### I'm getting the error "No module named 'tkinter'". How do I fix this?

Answer :

> Assumptions : you're trying to run the GUI on Ubuntu (or some other version of it, like Linux Mint)

This can be solved in 2 steps.

1. Open a terminal and type in this command: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
2. Enter your password (it will not be shown)

If the command doesn't work, you may need to run `sudo apt update` first then run the other command again. Once it's installed, the GUI should function correctly.
