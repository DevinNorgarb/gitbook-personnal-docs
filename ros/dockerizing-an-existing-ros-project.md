# Dockerizing an existing ROS project

{% embed url="https://github.com/tkunic/ros-docker-simple" %}



## ROS Docker Simple

A simple template project for [dockerizing](https://www.docker.com) your [ROS](http://www.ros.org) code. Have your ROS project set up and running in 3 minutes by putting your catkin workspace in `catkin_ws` and running:

```
sudo apt-get install docker
/script/build
/script/run
```

And that's it!

### FAQ

#### How can I use a different version of ROS?

This works with [any supported version of ROS](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ros/), just edit the top line of the Dockerfile. For example, if you want ROS Kinetic:

```
FROM ros:kinetic-ros-base
```

#### Can I use \[my favourite IDE/editor] with this?

Yup! The `catkin_ws` directory is mounted as a volume inside the container, so you can edit your code as usual, and it will be automatically synced with the container.

#### Where is my `catkin_ws` workspace mounted inside the container?

Inside the container, the `catkin_ws` folder will be mounted at root (`/catkin_ws`).

#### How do I install additional packages / dependencies / tools?

Add your dependencies to the RUN command in the `Dockerfile` (this example installs `tmux` and `ros-kinetic-serial` packages using apt, you can add any additional commands or packages you like).

#### I need another terminal window in the container!

I recommend [tmux](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course) as an easy way to manage multiple shells in ROS.

However, if you really want multiple terminal windows instead, you can open a new terminal window on your host computer and run:

```
docker exec -it ros-docker-simple /bin/bash
```

#### I want to run a different command on container startup!

You can give your command as an argument to `script/run`, for example:

```
script/run roslaunch example.launch
```

#### How do I pass a device (e.g. serial, joystick) to the container?

Edit `script/run` and add the line `--device=/dev/ttyUSB0 \` (changing the `/dev` path to match the path to your device).

#### How can I easily coordinate multiple containers and have them talk to one another?

The `docker-compose` tool is the standard way to run multiple containers together: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

#### Running the scripts gives me a `permission denied` error!

Is it this one?

```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.26/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
```

Reason: your user does not have privileges to run Docker. Put your user into the `docker` group or run with `sudo`.

#### It gives me a `/ros_entrypoint.sh: line 6: (...): No such file or directory` error!

Instead of giving it a command like this:

```
script/run "cd /tmp/ && ls"
```

Try this:

```
script/run sh -c "cd /tmp/ && ls"
```
