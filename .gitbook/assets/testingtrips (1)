<H1>Testing Trips</H1>

<P>OBD GPS Logger understands "trips". Basically, it means you can keep
multiple logs in the same database without issue. The logging tool
automatically stops and starts logging whenever the engine is turned
off and on. What you see on this page is the first test drive after I
implemented trips, with me just driving around turning the engine off
at some stoplights.</P>

<P>Height at each point indicates speed, and color indicates engine
efficiency at the time. You can see the MPG plummet as we accellerate
away from stops, and hit the maximum value as we slow down. The white
graph indicates engine RPM.</P>

<P>This trip was driving my Mini Cooper S.</P>
