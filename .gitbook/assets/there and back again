<H1>There and Back Again: Lunch in El Segundo</H1>

<P>Just going down to El Segundo for lunch, taking slightly different
paths each way. By the airport, there's a large apparently blank bit;
that's where I was in a tunnel and my GPS couldn't get a lock.</A>

<P>This trip was driving my Mini Cooper S.</P>
