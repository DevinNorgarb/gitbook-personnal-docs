Iâ€™ve been on a quest to find a new logging system. Iâ€™ve use quite a few in the past, some open source, some proprietary, and some home grown, but recently Iâ€™ve decided to switch. Iâ€™ve switched to Grafana Loki for all of my logs for all of my systems - this includes machines, devices, docker systems and hosts, and my all of my kubernetes clusters. If youâ€™re thinking of using Grafana and are also looking for a fast way to log all of your systems, join me as we discuss and configure Grafana Loki

Donâ€™t want to host it yourself? Check out Grafana Cloud and sign up for a free account [https://l.technotim.live/grafana-labs](https://l.technotim.live/grafana-labs)

### ARM CPU (Raspberry Pi) <a href="#arm-cpu-raspberry-pi" id="arm-cpu-raspberry-pi"></a>

There is a workaround for using this with ARM CPUs. Credit to [AndreiTelteu](https://github.com/AndreiTelteu) for finding this [in this discussion](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/discussions/97)

delete `/etc/docker/daemon.json`

Add the vector service to the docker-compose.yml file
