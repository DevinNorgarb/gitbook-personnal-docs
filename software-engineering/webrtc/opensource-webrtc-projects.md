WebRTC is an open-source framework that enables real-time communications for the web through your web browser.

In contrast, it is the basic protocol that allows web apps and websites to capture and stream videos and audio and exchange data between web browsers.

WebRTC is created first by Google to make peer-to-peer communication possible for web browsers and mobile apps, leading to dozens of video and audio communication apps that we use every day.

It is a free and open-source project, which means it does not require any cost to run and use it

Another Advantage for WebRTC is it is fast, and because, unlike UDP-based apps, it does not require any handshake between the client and the server.

Some may consider WebRTC standard not safe or secure because it exposes the real public IP of the user, therefore if you are using WebRTC with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox you are not anonymous.

In this article, you will find the best free, open-source WebRTC libraries and frameworks to build WebRTC-based projects.
