# Sorry Cypress

## Dashboard and API

Running the full sorry-cypress kit - setting up web dashboard to store and browse test resultsThe [basic](https://docs.sorry-cypress.dev/guide/get-started) setup of sorry-cypress is already quite useful - we can run cypress tests in parallel without any limitations.However, we want to store and see the test results and explore errors, screenshots and videos.

#### Running sorry-cypress kit <a href="#persisting-test-results" id="persisting-test-results"></a>

We are going to run the full sorry-cypress kit:

1. 1.`director` service will use MongoDB to store the test runs and the results
2. 2.`API` service (a GraphQL interface to MongoDB) to let us issue queries and retrieve tests results
3. 3.`Dashboard` service - a web dashboard for browsing the results
4. 4.â€‹[`minio`](https://min.io/product/overview) will let us store files - videos and screenshots generated by cypress agent

We are going to run all the services locally using `docker-compose`# get docker-compose filecurl --output docker-compose.minio.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress/master/docker-compose.minio.ymlâ€‹# start the servicesdocker-compose -f ./docker-compose.minio.yml up

* Make sure to install a modern version of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)â€‹
* Shut down any stale sorry-cypress services with `docker kill`

After successfully running docker-compose, we have:

* `director` service on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/)â€‹
* `API` service on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)â€‹
* `Dashboard` running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)â€‹

Open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)â€‹Create a project with the id you wrote as value for `projectId` in your `currents.config.js` file (e.g., "yyy").Empty sorry-cypress dashboard

#### Setup Screenshots Upload <a href="#setup-screenshots-upload" id="setup-screenshots-upload"></a>

We are using `minio` service to store files generated by cypress agents - video recordings and failed test screenshots. Each agent uploads the files directly to `minio` .Edit your `/etc/hosts` file to allow cypress agents to discover the local instance of `minio`127.0.0.1 storage

#### Running cypress tests in parallel. <a href="#running-cypress-tests-in-parallel" id="running-cypress-tests-in-parallel"></a>

`director` is running in a Docker container, but it is still accessible at [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234/). We have already reconfigured `cypress` to use this URL. Let's just rerun the tests.Open several terminal windows within a directory with tests and run `cypress` in each.# run in each terminalcypress-cloud run --parallel --record --key somekey --ci-build-id hello-cypressAs soon as agents start their execution, refresh the dashboard. You'd see a new project and a new run created.Use the same `--ci-build-id` value to associate different cypress agents with the same run. Learn more about [CI Build ID.](https://currents.dev/readme/guides/cypress-ci-build-id)â€‹

#### Exploring the dashboard <a href="#exploring-the-dashboard" id="exploring-the-dashboard"></a>

The dashboard is quite simple - go ahead and explore the tests you have just created.Dashboard example - list of tests and results for a runCongratulations ðŸŽ‰You have set up sorry-cypress on your local machine. Now you can run unlimited cypress tests and use the dashboard to browse the results.In the next article, we'll learn how to setup sorry-cypress in the cloud using different cloud providers.
