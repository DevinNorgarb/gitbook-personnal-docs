## Content

> A curated list of awesome [skills](https://docs.cursor.com/agent/skills) for [Cursor](https://cursor.com), the AI code editor.

Skills are reusable `SKILL.md` instruction files that teach the AI agent how to perform specific tasks — from setting up analytics to scaffolding entire projects. In cursor, they live in `.cursor/skills/` (personal) or project directories and are automatically discovered by the agent.

## Skills

Ready-to-use `SKILL.md` files you can copy into your `.cursor/skills/` directory. Each one teaches the agent a specific engineering workflow.

### Cursor-Native

Skills that harness Cursor's unique agent capabilities — things only an AI inside Cursor can do.

- [`suggesting-cursor-rules`](https://github.com/DevinNorgarb/awesome-cursor-skills/blob/main/resources/suggesting-cursor-rules/SKILL.md) - If you keep correcting the agent on the same convention, it suggests a `.cursor/rules/` file to encode it permanently.
- [`suggesting-cursor-hooks`](https://github.com/DevinNorgarb/awesome-cursor-skills/blob/main/resources/suggesting-cursor-hooks/SKILL.md) - If you keep asking the agent to run the same check (lint, types, tests), it suggests a `.cursor/hooks.json` hook to automate it.

## Key Takeaways
- Cursor **skills** are reusable `SKILL.md` files (personal `.cursor/skills/` or project-scoped) that teach the agent specific workflows.
- The upstream repo bundles **70+ ready-to-copy skills** under `resources/` plus links to community and vendor skills (Anthropic, Sentry, Vercel, PostHog, Matt Pocock, and others).
- **Cursor marketplace plugins** ship bundled skills for Figma, Linear, Sentry, Vercel, Firebase, Shopify, and many more integrations.
- **Cursor rules** (`.cursor/rules/`) complement skills: rules are always-on conventions; skills are on-demand workflows.
- Install community skills via `npx skills`, browse [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), or copy files directly from the repo's `resources/` directory.
